# TypingTutor

The user interface:  
At the beginning it will ask for a filename.  
This is the file name of the practice text in the same directory as the exe.  
The practice text included with the project is file.txt.  
Hit enter at the file name prompt if you want to go to the random mode.   
There you can practice with combination of numerals, alphabets and special symbols.  
If you opt no for all those combinations you can practice with small sentence that  
contain the words you fail to type quickly. You can choose whether to randomize that text.
